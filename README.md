Introduction: 

This project explores the impact of different work arrangements like remote, hybrid, and onsite on employee health and 
well being, using data from the Remote Work of Health Impact Survey (June 2025). The goal of this analysis is to identify trends and 
disparities in health outcomes across work types and demographics and to offer recommendations for employers and policymakers seeking to
*improve* workplace wellness in the post-pandemic era.

Insights :
- Remote workers reported the highest levels of social isolation, but also better work-life balance than onsite employees.
- Burnout levels were lowest among Remote workers, suggesting that flexible arrangements may reduce stress.

Recommendations:
- Promote hybrid work models where possible, they offer a balance between collaboration and flexibility while minimizing burnout and isolation.
- Redesign physical office spaces and routines to reduce physical strain and improve ergonomic conditions for onsite staff.
- Use regular employee surveys to track evolving health trends and adapt workplace policies accordingly.
- Invest in virtual wellness programs to support remote employees struggling with isolation and mental health.
Conclusion: In June 2025, employees working remotely were more likely to report social isolation and eye strain but had better work life 
balance than those working onsite. Burnout levels were highest among onsite employees. Hybrid workers showed the most balanced scores 
across physical and mental health metrics.
