# Data Analyst Portfolio
Hi! My name is Tenzin Kunchok and Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio.
I am currently a Junior in pursuing a Undergraduate degree in Computer information System with a concentration is Data Analytics.
In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics skills. You will find links of the dashboards and reports I have created using various tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. I have also included my work in programming languages such as Python, SQL and R. These projects showcase my ability to extract valuable insights from large and complex data sets, and to combine data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of the data. In addition to my technical skills, I also pride myself on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am able to approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, and to identify key issues and opportunities in the data.

I am confident that my data analytics skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for any data analyst role. I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.

Thank you for your time.
